        <h1>A library is a collection of sources of information and similar resources, made accessible to a defined community for reference or borrowing. It provides physical or digital access to material and may be a physical building or room, or a virtual space, or both. A library's collection can include books, periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts, films, maps, prints, documents, microform, CDs, cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, e-books, audiobooks, databases, and other formats. Libraries range in size from a few shelves of books to several million items. Sidney Sheldon perfectly describes: Libraries store the energy that fuels the imagination. They open up windows to the world and inspire us to explore and achieve, and contribute to improving our quality of life.</h1>
        <h1>Libraries are essential in a process of giving citizens access to knowledge. In digital times they are needed more than ever before. In times of the internet, everyone can visit a library without leaving home. Itâ€™s just a matter of opening a library website, and you can not only borrow an ebook but also ask the librarian an online question. Most importantly, however, libraries are the places where you can expect smart and clear answers to even the most difficult questions.</h1>
